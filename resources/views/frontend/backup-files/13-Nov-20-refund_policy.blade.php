				<h1>REFUND POLICY</h1>

<p class="top-p">All commissions payable to ACCRONIC PRIVATE LIMITED by Service Professionals on consummated transactions, i.e. exchange of services for consideration, are final and non-refundable.
All monies paid by Service Professionals in form of “Monthly Subscription” are non-interest bearing and shall be non-refundable to the Service Professionals. </p>

<h3>Client Refund Policy</h3>
<p class="top-p">When a payment of fee is made to Hire Bunny, the fee paid in advance is retained by Hire Bunny in a client account. Hire Bunny will earn the fees upon working on a client's matter. During an engagement, Hire Bunny earns fee at different rates and different times depending on the completion of various milestones. Refund cannot be provided for earned fee because resources and man hours spent on delivering the service are non-returnable in nature. Further, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. Under any circumstance, Hire Bunny shall be liable to refund only upto the fee paid by the client.</p>
<h3>Refund Request</h3>
<p class="top-p">Refund request can be initiated through help@fineagle.com or create a refund request ticket. All refund requests must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 15 to 25 business days of receiving all the information required for processing refund like reason for refund, bank details for processing request, etc.</p>
<h3>Change of Service</h3>
<p class="top-p">If you want to change the service you ordered for a different one, you must request this change of service within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original service, less any earned fee and money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your Hire Bunny account. You can use the balance credit for any other Hire Bunny service.</p>
<h3>Force Majeure</h3>
<p class="top-p">Hire Bunny shall not be considered in breach of its Satisfaction Guarantee policy or default under any terms of service, and shall not be liable to the Client for any cessation, interruption, or delay in the performance of its obligations by reason of earthquake, flood, fire, storm, lightning, drought, landslide, hurricane, cyclone, typhoon, tornado, natural disaster, act of God or the public enemy, epidemic, famine or plague, action of a court or public authority, change in law, explosion, war, terrorism, armed conflict, labor strike, lockout, boycott or similar event beyond our reasonable control, whether foreseen or unforeseen (each a "Force Majeure Event").</p>
<h3>Cancellation Fee</h3>
<p class="top-p">Since we're incurring costs and dedicating time, manpower, technology resources and effort to your service or document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by Hire Bunny - not changes to your situation or your state of mind. In case you require us to hold the processing of a service, we will hold the fee paid on your account until you are ready to commence the service.</p>
<p class="top-p">Before processing any refund, we reserve the right to make best effort to complete the service. In case, you are not satisfied with the service, a cancellation fee of 20% + earned fee + fee paid to government would be applicable. In case of change of service, the cancellation fee would not be applicable.</p>
